Disclamer:
I do not own https://qa-practice.netlify.app/.
The website is property of Razvan Vancea (https://razvanvancea.ro/), a trainer at 4MAYO, which allowed me to use the website to practice Automation.

About the project:

This project is made using Python, Selenium and Chromedriver.
The project automates the process of a customer loging into a site, selecting items and quantities and sending a purchase order.
